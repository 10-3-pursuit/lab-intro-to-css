      <h3>Hardest Bug So Far</h3>
      <p>
        My hardest bug I ever came across was in the Command Line Inventory Project when I was trying to figure out how to nest a loop that will calculate a quantity amount for each object while looping through the array of objects while also meeting a specific condition. 
      </p>
      <p>I came up with a totally sick solution though by first realizing that I was overthinking too much. I implemented a key within each object that would represent a quantity of one. The user would then input the quantity of how much they need. Once inputted it would multiply the key to the input and return the product.</p>
