    <h1>Lenny Lopez</h1>
    <div>
      <p>
        I'm 28 years old and I live in New York. The Bronx to be specific. When it comes to programming, that is something that has been on my mind for a couple years but never really pursued it until recently when I reconnected with an old friend and learned that he was a 'programmer'. More importantly he told me that he had completed the Pursuit program. After that one thing led to another and here I am, at Pursuit. Besides programming, I'm big on exercise. I like to stay active as much as I can. When I'm at home and if there's time I'll search for something really good to watch. If not that then I'll just get on my Xbox and chat/play with friends.

      <h3>Hardest Bug So Far</h3>
      <p>
        My hardest bug I ever came across so far probably has do to do with some sort of for loop. 
        <br>I'm not exactly sure but around that area.
      </p>
      <p>The solution I came up with was just looking back at what I learned previously along with the help of chatGPT.</p>
