    <h1 style="color: green;"> Code To The Core</h1>
    <div>
      <p>
        My name is Cornell Robertson, A.K.A Core The Producer, A.K.A Code To The Core,
        and I discovered a passion for coding after my journey of working
       in the delivery service buisness with uber eats since 2015, after my first 20,000 They introduced
       me to pursuit after I explained to them I really needed help because even tho I was 
       making money, I felt like I was not profilling my dreams as a audio engineer and achieving my goals of making it 
       in the cartoons and video game industry. when I came across pursuit and checked out the program I instantly seen How 
       I can liven things up and expand my audio engineer career with becoming a 
       software developer also.  Things I learned in audio class like the in's and out's 
       of how computers manifest certain programs data is something you have to learn as a audio engineer to make sure you dont over load things with to much info and crash the programs, so i looked at it in a way related if you know what I mean!
       (also Interms of how a audio visuals in games and cartoons have and relation ship wih coding an programing or a how apps pages use 
       specific art pictures or videos are created to make its contents and data for sites is related. )
       As well a software engineer, in the terms of codes and how they work and allow you to communicate 
       to programs or cpu to delevep the program applications itself is related.
       So I know for a fact being a programmer will help me  expand my goals out extrodinare to the an extreme fullstack software sound production engineer and  still giving me the opportunity to do both trades at the same time.
          When Im not in software class or studying, I like to workout and eat healthy, and I like to stay home sharping up my mix and production skills in my studio. 
           I can't really afford to work UberEats at this point as much because doing a job like that where Im constanly on the go delivering 
           will take to much time for me to make the amount of money I need to make and still get all the curriculium I need to pass, 
           It will just distract me or knock me off course and not have energy to learn properly. so I save that one for last now, 
            Noting wrong with still having my uber accounts for income, but just not going to be able do it much with all the focus needed. 
           mean while I'll be looking to find a more liable income where I can still focus on my software lessons and music productions skills at a accordingly basis.

      <h3>Hardest Bug So Far</h3>
      <p>
        My hardest bug I came across during this software development process thus far is memorizing so much logic so fast and understanding everything out thus far at once, but I get it  it takes practice, time and dedication.
      </p>
      <p>I came up with a totally sick solution though by doing repeat reps on lessons and video note taking for my memory to be able to keep up the pace and memorize faster</p>
