      <p>
        I was born and raised in Bronx, New York. I have always had a secret
        interest in tech but never actually looked into learning about it
        because I always thought it was for genuises only. It wasn't until a
        friend of mine sent me a link to Pursuit that I actually thought
        learning to code was a possibility. However, when I attended the
        information session I felt intimidated of how difficult and intense it
        seemed so I did not bother apllying.
        <br />
        <br />
        A year later, I felt I was finally ready for a change in careers so I
        attended a Pursuit info session <span>AGAIN</span> and decided to commit
        to the change.
        <br />
        <br />
        So far it is definitely <span>TOUGH</span> but i am lovong the
        process<strong>!</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        When I'm not working I'm busy being a mom to my amazing 11 year old
        daughter, <span>Jermany</span>.
