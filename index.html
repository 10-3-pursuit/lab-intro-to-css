      <p>
        I have a plethora of aliases, meaning -- I have several nicknames, don't ask. 
        It just means I'm loved even that more. I've lived in LA most of my adult life,
        but I was born and raised in Trinidad. This soulster once lived in the ATL  
        for college at MLK's alma mata + made Manhattan his playpen at NYU. Today, I 
        live in and for Brooklyn! I'm still trying to discover what my passion in 
        programming will be, but it ain't gaming. I'm many <a href="#">'tings</a>, but most of all, I'm
        very grateful for this opp at Pursuit. OK, wishing everyone in this fellowship 
        the very best in their career ahead, I'm off to code!
